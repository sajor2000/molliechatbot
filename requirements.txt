# Python dependencies for Vercel deployment
#
# IMPORTANT: Vercel serverless functions have a 250MB size limit.
# Heavy ML packages (docling, torch, transformers) CANNOT be deployed.
#
# Alternative solutions for document processing:
# 1. Use Vercel's built-in capabilities with Node.js libraries
# 2. Use external APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) for document parsing
# 3. Deploy document processing separately on Modal, AWS Lambda with layers, or dedicated servers
# 4. Pre-process documents locally and upload embeddings directly
#
# This file is intentionally minimal to allow Vercel deployment to succeed.
