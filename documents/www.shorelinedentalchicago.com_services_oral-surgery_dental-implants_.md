# Dental Implants Chicago, IL

At Shoreline Dental Chicago, we are proud to offer dental implants as a reliable and long-lasting solution for replacing missing teeth. Dental implants are designed to mimic the structure of natural teeth, including both the crown and the root. The implant itself is a small titanium post that is surgically placed into your jawbone, providing a stable foundation for an artificial tooth or other dental restorations.

## Are Dental Implants Right for You?

Dental implants are a great option for many patients, but certain factors determine if they are the best fit for your needs. You may be a good candidate if you:

- Have one or more missing teeth
- Possess sufficient jawbone density to support the implant
- Maintain good oral health and hygiene
- Are free of health conditions that could interfere with healing

If your jawbone has weakened or deteriorated over time, a bone grafting procedure may be recommended before implant placement to ensure long-term stability.

## What to Expect During Treatment

The dental implant process typically involves two main stages. First, the titanium post is surgically inserted into the jawbone. Over the next few months, a natural process called osseointegration occurs, during which the implant fuses with the bone, creating a secure and permanent base.

Once the implant has fully integrated, an abutment is attached to the post. This connector piece allows your custom restoration — whether a [dental crown](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-crowns/ "Dental Crowns"), [bridge](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-bridges/ "Dental Bridges") or [denture](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/oral-surgery/implant-supported-dentures/ "Implant-Supported Dentures") — to be securely placed. Our dentists and team carefully craft each restoration to match your natural teeth in size, shape and color, ensuring a seamless and comfortable result.

### Experience the Benefits of Dental Implants

Dental implants not only restore the appearance of your smile but also improve functionality and support oral health. Unlike other tooth replacement options, implants stimulate the jawbone, preventing bone loss and maintaining facial structure. With proper care, dental implants can last for decades.
