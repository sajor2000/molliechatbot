# Root Canal Treatment Chicago, IL

Root canal treatment is an advanced dental procedure designed to save your natural tooth from severe damage or infection. This form of endodontic therapy effectively addresses infections deep within the tooth, targeting bacteria in the dental pulp. This pulp can become infected due to deep cavities, fractures or repeated dental procedures. If left untreated, the infection can spread, leading to pain, swelling and even tooth loss. Root canal treatment helps preserve your tooth and maintain your oral health.

## Signs You May Need a Root Canal

Recognizing the symptoms of a tooth infection can help you seek timely treatment. Some common signs that indicate you may need a root canal include:

- Persistent pain when chewing or biting
- Lingering sensitivity to hot or cold foods
- Swollen or tender gums near the affected tooth
- A cracked or chipped tooth
- Discoloration or darkening of the tooth

If you are experiencing these symptoms, it is essential to contact our dentists and team promptly to prevent further complications.

## The Root Canal Procedure

Root canal treatment involves a series of precise steps to eliminate infection and restore the tooth’s structure. First, our dentists will numb the area to ensure your comfort throughout the procedure. Then, the infected or damaged pulp is removed from the tooth. The interior of the tooth is thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to eliminate any remaining bacteria. Once the tooth is free of infection, it is filled and sealed with a biocompatible material to prevent future issues. In most cases, a [dental crown](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-crowns/ "Dental Crowns") is placed over the tooth to restore its strength and appearance.

### Benefits of Root Canal Treatment

A root canal can save your natural tooth, sparing you the need for extraction and replacement. By addressing the infection, this treatment also prevents the spread of bacteria to other parts of your mouth. Additionally, preserving your tooth helps maintain proper chewing function and alignment of your teeth.
