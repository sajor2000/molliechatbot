# Fluoride Treatment Chicago, IL

Fluoride treatment is a simple yet powerful way to protect your teeth from decay and keep your smile healthy. Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that strengthens the enamel, the outer layer of your teeth. This added strength helps to prevent the development of cavities and reduces the risk of tooth decay, which, if untreated, can lead to more complex dental issues.

## When is Fluoride Treatment Recommended?

[Dr. Mollie Rojas and Dr. Sonal Patel](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/about/meet-our-team/ "Meet Our Team") recommend fluoride treatment for patients of all ages as part of a comprehensive oral health routine. While fluoride is commonly found in tap water and toothpaste, professional fluoride treatments provide a concentrated dose that offers added protection for your teeth.

## Quick and Effective Application

The fluoride treatment process is both quick and painless. During your appointment, our dentists or hygienist will apply a fluoride varnish, gel or foam directly to your teeth. This is typically done with a small brush or a tray that fits comfortably in your mouth. The fluoride then begins to harden almost instantly upon contact with your saliva, forming a protective barrier over your enamel and working to remineralize your teeth and strengthen them against cavities and decay.

To ensure the treatment is as effective as possible, we recommend avoiding eating, drinking hot liquids and brushing or flossing your teeth for at least six hours afterward. This allows the fluoride to fully adhere to the enamel and provide maximum benefits.

## A Simple Step Toward Better Oral Health

Regular fluoride treatments can be performed every six to 12 months, depending on your individual needs. These treatments are particularly beneficial for children, individuals prone to cavities or those with weakened enamel. By reinforcing your enamel, fluoride helps to minimize the need for future restorative procedures, saving you time and money in the long run.
