# Dental Bridges Chicago, IL

Dental bridges offer a reliable, long-lasting solution for replacing missing teeth. Whether you are missing one tooth or several, a dental bridge can restore your ability to eat, speak and smile with confidence. This fixed dental [restoration](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/ "Restorative Dentistry") not only improves your oral function but also enhances your smile’s appearance and prevents potential complications caused by missing teeth.

## The Dental Bridge Process

Getting a dental bridge typically requires two appointments. During the first visit, our dentists will prepare the teeth on either side of the gap, which will serve as anchors for the bridge. These teeth are fitted with [crowns](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-crowns/ "Dental Crowns") that support the artificial tooth, known as a pontic, that fills the space of the missing tooth. Once the area is prepared, precise impressions are taken to create a custom bridge that matches your unique dental structure.

At your second appointment, the bridge is carefully placed, adjusted for a comfortable fit and secured. This personalized approach ensures the restoration not only looks natural but also functions as intended. Modern bridges are crafted from durable materials, such as porcelain or ceramic, to provide strength and a lifelike appearance.

## The Benefits of Dental Bridges

Dental bridges are designed to offer both functional and aesthetic advantages. With a custom-fitted bridge, you can expect:

- Improved ability to chew and speak comfortably.
- Preservation of your facial structure by preventing bone loss.
- Prevention of misalignment as surrounding teeth are held in place.
- A natural-looking restoration that blends seamlessly with your smile.

### Long-Lasting Results

With proper care, a dental bridge can last many years. Routine oral hygiene, including brushing, flossing and [regular dental checkups](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/general-family-dentistry/dental-cleanings/ "Dental Cleanings"), is essential to maintaining your restoration and overall oral health.

### FAQ

**What are dental bridges, and how do they work?**

Dental bridges are fixed dental restorations used to replace missing teeth. They consist of one or more artificial teeth, supported by crowns placed on the natural teeth or on [dental implants](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/oral-surgery/dental-implants/ "Dental Implants") adjacent to the gap. This design restores oral function, enhances appearance and prevents teeth from shifting out of alignment.

**How long does it take to get a dental bridge?**

The process usually requires two appointments to complete, one at which our dentists takes impressions and prepares the teeth for the bridge, and one at which the bridge is bonded into place. We will discuss the timeline for your treatment as part of your initial consultation.

**How do I care for my dental bridge?**

Proper care involves regular brushing and flossing, especially around the bridge and supporting teeth. Using floss threaders or interdental brushes can help clean hard-to-reach areas. Routine dental checkups are essential to monitor your bridge’s condition and maintain overall oral health for long-lasting results.

**How long does a dental bridge last?**

With good oral hygiene and regular dental care, a dental bridge can last 10 years or longer. Durability depends on the materials used, your oral habits and maintenance. Avoid chewing hard objects and follow the care recommendations provided by our dentists and team to maximize your bridge’s lifespan.
