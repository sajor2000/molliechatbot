## Services Offered

### Cosmetic Dentistry

**Dental Bonding**
Dental bonding is a cosmetic procedure that uses tooth-colored composite resin to repair chipped, cracked, or discolored teeth. It's a quick and affordable way to enhance your smile.

**Dental Veneers**
Porcelain veneers are thin shells of ceramic that are bonded to the front of teeth to create a beautiful, natural-looking smile. Veneers can correct gaps, chips, stains, and misalignment.

**Full-Mouth Rehabilitation**
For patients with extensive dental needs, we offer full-mouth rehabilitation to restore function, health, and aesthetics through comprehensive treatment planning.

**Teeth Whitening**
Professional teeth whitening treatments can brighten your smile by several shades. We offer both in-office and take-home whitening options.

**Orthodontics**
We provide clear aligner therapy with ClearCorrect and Invisalign®, offering a discreet way to straighten teeth without traditional metal braces.

### General & Family Dentistry

**Dental Cleanings**
Regular professional cleanings every six months help prevent cavities, gum disease, and other oral health issues. Our hygienists provide thorough, gentle cleanings.

**Dental Sealants**
Protective sealants are applied to the chewing surfaces of back teeth to prevent cavities, especially beneficial for children and teenagers.

**Emergency Dentistry**
We provide same-day emergency appointments for dental trauma, severe pain, infections, and other urgent dental issues. Call immediately at 312-266-9487 for emergency assistance.

**Fluoride Treatments**
Professional fluoride applications help strengthen tooth enamel and prevent decay, particularly important for children and patients at high risk for cavities.

**Night Guards**
Custom-fitted night guards protect teeth from grinding and clenching (bruxism) during sleep, preventing wear and jaw pain.

**Sleep Apnea Treatment**
We offer oral appliance therapy for patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea, providing a comfortable alternative to CPAP machines.

**Sports Mouth Guards**
Custom athletic mouth guards provide superior protection for athletes in contact sports, preventing dental injuries and concussions.

### Oral Surgery

**All-on-4® Dental Implants**
The All-on-4® technique uses just four strategically placed dental implants to support a full arch of replacement teeth, offering a permanent solution for complete tooth loss.

**Dental Implants**
Dental implants are titanium posts surgically placed in the jawbone to replace missing tooth roots. They provide the foundation for permanent or removable replacement teeth.

**Implant-Supported Dentures**
These dentures are securely anchored by dental implants, providing superior stability and function compared to traditional dentures.

**Tooth Extractions**
When a tooth cannot be saved, we perform gentle extractions using modern techniques to ensure patient comfort and promote rapid healing.

### Restorative Dentistry

**Dental Bridges**
Fixed bridges replace one or more missing teeth by anchoring artificial teeth to adjacent natural teeth or implants.

**Dental Crowns**
Crowns are custom-made caps that cover damaged or weakened teeth, restoring their shape, strength, and appearance.

**Dental Fillings**
We use tooth-colored composite fillings to repair cavities, providing a natural-looking and durable restoration.

**Dental Inlays & Onlays**
These are custom-made restorations used when a tooth has moderate decay or damage that's too extensive for a filling but doesn't require a full crown.

**Dentures**
We create custom full and partial dentures to replace missing teeth, restoring function and aesthetics for patients with significant tooth loss.

**Gum Disease Treatment**
We provide comprehensive periodontal therapy to treat gingivitis and periodontitis, including deep cleanings, scaling, root planing, and maintenance care.

**Root Canal Treatments**
Endodontic therapy saves infected or damaged teeth by removing diseased pulp tissue, cleaning the canal system, and sealing the tooth.

**Scaling & Root Planing**
This deep cleaning procedure treats gum disease by removing plaque and tartar from below the gum line and smoothing root surfaces to promote healing.
