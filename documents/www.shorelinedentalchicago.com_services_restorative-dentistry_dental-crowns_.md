# Dental Crowns Chicago, IL

A dental crown, also known as a cap, is a versatile restoration designed to address various dental concerns. Whether your tooth is weakened, damaged or decayed, a crown can provide the protection and support needed to restore its function and appearance. Custom-made to fit snugly over your tooth, a crown extends from the gumline, recreating its natural shape and size. Crowns can be crafted from different materials, including porcelain, gold or porcelain fused to metal. Porcelain crowns are a popular choice because they blend seamlessly with the natural color of your teeth, offering both durability and aesthetics.

## When Is a Dental Crown Needed?

Dental crowns are often recommended for teeth that are too damaged or decayed for a [filling](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-fillings/ "Dental Fillings") to suffice. Crowns not only restore the structural integrity of a tooth but also enhance its appearance and function. You might benefit from a dental crown if you have:

- A tooth weakened by decay or a large filling.
- Undergone [root canal treatment](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/root-canal-treatments/ "Root Canal Treatments") and need to protect the treated tooth.
- A fractured or cracked tooth that requires reinforcement.
- A [dental implant](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/oral-surgery/dental-implants/ "Dental Implants") that needs completion with a natural-looking crown.
- A misshapen or severely discolored tooth that affects your smile’s [aesthetics](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/ "Cosmetic Dentistry").

## The Dental Crown Process

The process of getting a dental crown typically involves two visits to our dentists and team. During the first visit, we prepare the tooth by removing any decay or damaged areas and shaping it to fit the crown. An impression of the tooth is taken to create a custom-made crown that matches the size, shape and color of your natural teeth. A temporary crown is placed to protect the tooth while the permanent crown is being fabricated. At the second visit, [Dr. Mollie Rojas or Dr. Sonal Patel](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/about/meet-our-team/ "Meet Our Team") will remove the temporary crown and fits the permanent one, ensuring it fits comfortably and aligns properly with your bite. The crown is then securely bonded to the tooth, restoring its strength and appearance.

### Additional Benefits of Dental Crowns

Dental crowns are incredibly versatile and can also be used to anchor [dental bridges](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-bridges/ "Dental Bridges"), providing a stable solution for replacing missing teeth. They strengthen and protect teeth that have suffered significant damage while enhancing the overall appearance of your smile.

### Personalized Care for Your Unique Smile

Your smile deserves a solution tailored to your needs. Our dentists will assess your oral health, discuss your preferences and help you choose the material and design best suited for your crown. Whether you are addressing functional concerns or improving your smile’s aesthetics, we are here to ensure you receive a restoration that blends beautifully and performs effectively.

### FAQ

**What is a dental crown used for?**

A dental crown is used to restore a tooth that is damaged, decayed or weakened. It protects the tooth by covering it completely, restoring its strength and functionality. Crowns are also used for cosmetic purposes, such as improving the appearance of discolored or misshapen teeth.

**How long does a dental crown last?**

With proper care, dental crowns typically last between 10 and 15 years. The lifespan depends on factors like oral hygiene, dietary habits and avoiding habits such as grinding your teeth. Regular dental checkups ensure your crown stays in good condition and performs as intended.

**Does getting a dental crown hurt?**

The process of getting a dental crown is generally not painful. Our dentists will numb the area to ensure comfort during the procedure. Afterward, you may experience mild sensitivity, but this typically subsides quickly. If you feel significant discomfort, we can adjust the crown for a perfect fit.

**How do I take care of my dental crown?**

Caring for a dental crown is similar to caring for your natural teeth. Brush twice daily, floss regularly and use fluoridated toothpaste. Avoid chewing on hard objects like ice to prevent damage. Regular dental visits help monitor your crown and overall oral health for long-term success.
