# Scaling & Root Planing Chicago, IL

Scaling and root planing is a highly effective treatment for managing [gum disease](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/gum-disease-treatment/ "Gum Disease Treatment") in its early and moderate stages. This nonsurgical procedure addresses the underlying causes of periodontal issues, helping to preserve your gum health and prevent tooth loss. By thoroughly cleaning below the gumline, scaling and root planing targets plaque, tartar and harmful bacteria that contribute to gum inflammation and infection.

## What Happens During Scaling and Root Planing?

The treatment involves two key steps:

- **Scaling:** This step removes plaque and tartar from both the surfaces of your teeth and the areas below the gumline. Special dental instruments are used to clean these hard-to-reach areas thoroughly.
- **Root Planing:** Following scaling, the roots of your teeth are smoothed to eliminate bacterial toxins and create a healthier surface for your gums to reattach. Smoother roots also make it harder for bacteria to accumulate in the future.

Scaling and root planing is often performed in stages, focusing on different areas of the mouth during separate appointments. This approach ensures that each section is cleaned thoroughly while keeping the procedure as comfortable as possible. Scaling and root planing may be paired with other periodontal therapies, such as localized antibiotic treatments, to enhance its effectiveness.

## Benefits of Scaling & Root Planing

This deep cleaning treatment helps reduce inflammation, prevent further gum recession and protect your overall oral health. In many cases, scaling and root planing alone can halt the progression of periodontal disease, making additional treatments unnecessary.

### What to Expect During & After Treatment

Most patients tolerate scaling and root planing well, but our dentists and team offer anesthetic options to ensure your comfort during the procedure. After treatment, you may experience mild tenderness, but this typically subsides within a few days. Practicing good oral hygiene at home and attending regular dental checkups are essential for maintaining your results.
