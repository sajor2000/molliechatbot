# Dental Sealants Chicago, IL

Dental sealants are an excellent preventive measure to protect your teeth from cavities and decay. Applied as a thin, protective coating, sealants create a barrier that keeps bacteria and food particles from settling into the grooves and pits of your teeth. This extra layer of protection is especially beneficial for molars, where decay is most likely to occur.

## The Sealant Application Process

The process of applying dental sealants is quick, painless and noninvasive. To begin, the tooth is thoroughly cleaned and dried to ensure a smooth surface. Next, a special gel is applied to gently etch the surface, which helps the sealant bond securely. Once the gel is rinsed off and the tooth is dried again, our dentists or hygienist will carefully paint the sealant material onto the tooth. A curing light is used to harden the sealant, creating a durable shield that blends naturally with your teeth.

### Who Can Benefit from Dental Sealants?

Dental sealants are suitable for both children and adults. Children, in particular, benefit from sealants as soon as their permanent molars erupt, typically around ages 6 and 12. Sealants provide crucial protection during these formative years when cavities are a common concern. Adults with healthy teeth free of decay or fillings can also benefit from sealants to maintain their oral health and prevent future issues.

### Long-Lasting Protection

One of the key advantages of dental sealants is their longevity. When properly applied and maintained, sealan [ts can last several years, providing reliable protection against cavities.](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/general-family-dentistry/dental-cleanings/ "Dental Cleanings") However, regular dental visits are essential to ensure that the sealants remain intact and effective. If any wear or chipping occurs, our dentists can easily repair or replace the sealant.

### Maintaining Your Oral Health

While dental sealants offer significant protection, they are not a substitute for good oral hygiene. Brushing twice a day, flossing daily and visiting Shoreline Dental Chicago for regular cleanings and exams are still vital for maintaining a healthy smile.
