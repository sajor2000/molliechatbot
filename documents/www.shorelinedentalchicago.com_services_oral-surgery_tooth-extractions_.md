# Tooth Extractions Chicago, IL

Tooth extractions play a vital role in maintaining your oral health, especially when other treatment options cannot resolve certain dental issues. Removing a problematic tooth can prevent further complications and restore balance to your smile. At Shoreline Dental Chicago, we perform extractions with precision and care to ensure your comfort and long-term oral health.

## When Is a Tooth Extraction Necessary?

There are several reasons why a tooth extraction may be recommended. Common circumstances include:

- Severe tooth decay or cavities
- Advanced gum disease
- Impacted wisdom teeth
- Tooth damage due to trauma
- Overcrowding in preparation for [orthodontic treatment](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/orthodontics/ "Orthodontics")
- Creating space for a dental prosthesis

Each case is carefully evaluated to determine the best course of action for your unique situation. Our goal is always to preserve your natural teeth whenever possible.

### Types of Extractions

We offer both simple and surgical extractions to meet your dental needs. A simple extraction is performed when the tooth is visible and can be removed in one piece. This procedure is straightforward and typically involves minimal recovery time.

For teeth that are broken, impacted or surrounded by gum or bone tissue, a surgical extraction may be necessary. This involves removing the tooth in sections to ensure minimal disruption to surrounding structures.

### Recovery and Aftercare

Proper aftercare is crucial to a smooth recovery. We recommend avoiding vigorous rinsing, smoking or drinking through a straw for the first few days after your extraction to protect the healing site. Follow the dietary guidelines provided, which may include soft foods and plenty of hydration.

Swelling and mild discomfort are normal but should improve within a few days. If you experience prolonged pain, excessive bleeding or signs of infection, contact our office immediately for assistance.

### Restore Your Smile

If you are concerned about replacing a missing tooth, Our skilled dentists and team offer a range of restorative options, including [dental implants](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/oral-surgery/dental-implants/ "Dental Implants"), [bridges](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-bridges/ "Dental Bridges") and [dentures](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/oral-surgery/implant-supported-dentures/ "Implant-Supported Dentures").
