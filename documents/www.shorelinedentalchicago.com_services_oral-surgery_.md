# Oral Surgery Chicago, IL

[Routine dental care](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/general-family-dentistry/dental-cleanings/ "Dental Cleanings") is essential for maintaining a clean and healthy smile, but some oral health issues require specialized attention. In these cases, oral surgery can provide effective solutions to improve your smile’s health, function and appearance. At Shoreline Dental Chicago, we offer various oral surgery options designed to address complex dental concerns and support your overall wellbeing.

## Reasons You May Need Oral Surgery

Oral surgery can resolve issues that extend beyond the surface of your teeth, addressing problems with the gums, jaw and supporting structures. Some common reasons for oral surgery include:

- **Tooth Extractions:** When a tooth is damaged beyond repair or poses a threat to your oral health, removing it may be necessary to prevent further complications.
- **Wisdom Teeth Removal:** Impacted or improperly aligned wisdom teeth can cause pain, crowding or infections. Removing them helps protect your smile’s health.
- **Bone Grafting:** If your jawbone has weakened due to tooth loss or other conditions, a bone graft can strengthen it, making it suitable for procedures like dental implants.
- **Gum Surgery:** Certain cases of advanced gum disease may require surgical intervention to restore gum health and prevent tooth loss.
