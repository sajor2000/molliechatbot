# Emergency Dentist Chicago, IL

Dental emergencies can be stressful, painful and unpredictable. At Shoreline Dental Chicago, we prioritize your comfort and oral health, offering swift and effective care when you need it most. Whether you are dealing with a sudden injury or an unexpected dental issue, we are here to help you regain your smile and peace of mind.

If you are experiencing a dental emergency, please call us at 312-266-9487 as soon as possible to meet with [Dr. Mollie Rojas or Dr. Sonal Patel](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/about/meet-our-team/ "Meet Our Team") and receive the care you need.

## What Is Considered a Dental Emergency?

A dental emergency encompasses any situation requiring immediate attention to alleviate pain, stop bleeding or prevent further damage. Common emergencies we address include:

- Cracked, fractured or chipped teeth
- Severe toothaches or swelling
- Lost [fillings](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-fillings/ "Dental Fillings"), [crowns](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-crowns/ "Dental Crowns") or other restorations
- Bleeding or injured gums, lips or tongue
- Knocked-out teeth

If you are unsure whether your situation qualifies as an emergency, it is better to err on the side of caution. [Contact](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/contact-us/ "Contact Us") our office at [312-266-9487](tel:312-266-9487) and we will guide you on the next steps.

### Non-Urgent Dental Concerns

Not all oral discomfort requires immediate attention. Issues like mild sensitivity, sore gums or minor discomfort may signal the need for a checkup rather than urgent care. These concerns are best addressed during regular office hours. However, if your symptoms worsen, do not hesitate to reach out for guidance.

### What to Do in a Dental Emergency

In the event of a dental emergency, call our office immediately. Our team will provide instructions tailored to your situation. For example:

- If a tooth is knocked out, keep it moist by placing it in milk or saliva and avoid touching the root.
- For severe pain or swelling, apply a cold compress to the affected area to reduce inflammation.

We will arrange for you to meet with our dentists as quickly as possible to resolve your emergency and help you regain your oral health.

### We Are Here for You

Your oral health is our priority. Dental emergencies can happen at any time, and our experienced team is ready to provide the care you need. Do not let pain or discomfort disrupt your life. [Contact us](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/contact-us/ "Contact Us") as soon as possible to schedule an emergency appointment. Our goal is to address your concerns quickly, effectively and compassionately.

### Patient Reviews

Dr. Rojas is the best dentist I’ve ever been to. She’s clearly extremely knowledgeable and she is very kind. The staff is also excellent. I would recommend this place to anyone.

Zoc Doc. I’m so glad I did! Everyone was beyond friendly and efficient. Also, my teeth have never felt cleaner. Loved it here and will be recommending to everyone I know!

I've had great experiences with Shoreline Dental. Dr. Rojas, Marybeth, and the whole staff are friendly, efficient, and accommodating.

Marybeth is SIMPLY THE BEST dental hygienist EVER!!! She notices everything and she is extremely careful, diligent and thorough. I have also been extremely impressed with Dr. Rojas and the COVID protections that she instituted. Bravo!
