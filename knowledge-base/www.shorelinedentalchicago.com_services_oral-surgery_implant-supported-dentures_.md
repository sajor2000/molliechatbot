# Implant-Supported Dentures Chicago, IL

Implant-supported dentures are a transformative option for individuals struggling with multiple missing teeth. These restorations are securely anchored to [dental implants](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/oral-surgery/dental-implants/ "Dental Implants") placed in the jawbone, offering superior stability, durability and comfort compared to [traditional dentures](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dentures/ "Dentures"). If you are considering options to restore your smile, implant-supported dentures may provide the functional and aesthetic solution you need.

[Dr. Mollie Rojas, Dr. Sonal Patel](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/about/meet-our-team/ "Meet Our Team") and our team are dedicated to helping you achieve optimal oral health and can guide you through the process of obtaining implant-supported dentures. During your initial consultation, our experienced dentists will evaluate your oral health, including the condition of your gums, jawbone and existing teeth, to create a personalized treatment plan tailored to your needs.

## Why Choose Implant-Supported Dentures?

## Unlike traditional dentures, implant-supported dentures do not rely on adhesives or suction to stay in place. Instead, they are securely attached to dental implants that fuse with your jawbone, providing a stable foundation. This design prevents slipping and discomfort, allowing you to eat, speak and smile with confidence.    To qualify for implant-supported dentures, it is essential to have healthy gums, a strong jawbone and good overall oral hygiene. If your oral health requires improvement before the procedure, our dentists can recommend treatments to prepare you for successful implant placement.

## The Implant-Supported Denture Process

## The process begins with the surgical placement of dental implants into your jawbone. Depending on your specific needs, [four](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/oral-surgery/all-on-4-dental-implants/ "All-on-4® Dental Implants") to six implants may be required to support each denture. After the implants are placed, a healing period allows the implants to integrate with the jawbone, ensuring a secure fit. Once the healing phase is complete, your custom dentures will be attached to the implants, providing a natural-looking and functional smile.          Media - My Visual Tutor
