# Dental Veneers Chicago, IL

Dental veneers are a popular [cosmetic](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/ "Cosmetic Dentistry") dental treatment designed to enhance the appearance of your smile. These thin, custom-made shells are carefully bonded to the front surface of your teeth to correct a variety of imperfections. Veneers provide a natural, polished look, making them an excellent choice for anyone seeking a confident, radiant smile.

## What Can Dental Veneers Fix?

Dental veneers are versatile and can address a range of dental imperfections. Common issues treated with veneers include:

- Stubborn tooth stains that resist [whitening](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-whitening/ "Teeth Whitening")
- Chipped or worn-down teeth
- Unevenly spaced or gapped teeth
- Slightly misaligned teeth
- Misshapen or irregularly sized teeth

With veneers, you can achieve a uniform, aesthetically pleasing smile that complements your facial features.

## What to Expect During the Veneer Process

Getting veneers typically involves a series of steps designed to ensure a flawless fit and appearance:

1. Consultation: During your initial visit, our dentists will discuss your goals, evaluate your oral health and determine whether veneers are right for you. We may take impressions and photos to create a customized treatment plan.
2. Preparation: A thin layer of enamel is removed from the surface of your teeth to make room for the veneers. Temporary veneers may be placed while your permanent ones are being crafted.
3. Placement: Once your custom veneers are ready, they will be bonded to your teeth using a strong dental adhesive. Our dentists will ensure the fit, color and shape are perfect before finalizing the placement.

### What Are the Benefits of Dental Veneers?

Dental veneers are more than just a cosmetic solution; they are an investment in a beautiful, confident smile that can enhance your overall quality of life. Veneers are designed to elevate your teeth’s appearance while offering a range of practical advantages, including:

- A natural and radiant appearance for your teeth and smile – veneers are designed to provide you with the most naturally aesthetic final result possible
- A long-lasting and durable solution – veneers are built to withstand the test of time, and with proper care can last for many years
- Boosted confidence in your smile and overall appearance – with veneers, you can always feel confident in sharing your smile
- A minimally invasive treatment – veneers are significantly less invasive than other restorative or cosmetic dental treatment, removing only a small amount of tooth enamel
- Improved tooth function – achieving an optimal shape and structure for your teeth means it is easier to bite and chew properly

### FAQ

**What are dental veneers made of?**

Dental veneers are typically made of either porcelain or composite resin. Porcelain veneers are durable, stain-resistant and mimic the natural translucency of tooth enamel. Composite resin veneers are more cost-effective and can be applied in a single visit. Both materials are designed to match your natural teeth seamlessly.

**How long do dental veneers last?**

Porcelain veneers can last 10 to 15 years or longer with proper care, while composite veneers typically last five to seven years. Maintaining good oral hygiene, avoiding habits like teeth grinding and regular dental checkups can help extend the lifespan of your veneers and keep them looking their best.

**Are dental veneers a permanent solution?**

Dental veneers are a long-lasting cosmetic solution but not entirely permanent. Because the process involves removing a thin layer of enamel, veneers are considered irreversible. If a veneer becomes damaged or worn over time, it will need to be replaced to maintain the appearance and function of your smile.

**Do veneers require special care?**

Veneers do not require special care beyond your regular oral hygiene routine. Brush twice daily with a non-abrasive toothpaste, floss regularly and visit our dentists for checkups. Avoid biting on hard objects and protect your teeth if you grind them or play sports to preserve your veneers.

**What areas do you serve?**
