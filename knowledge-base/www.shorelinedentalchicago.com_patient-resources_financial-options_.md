# Affordable Dentist Chicago, IL

If you are someone who is uninsured, do not worry! Our dentists and team offer a dental savings program where we provide in-office financing options that can suit your needs. Simply pay a certain amount to cover a variety of treatments over a set period of months to a year. We also work with CareCredit® financing: a third-party group that helps cover medical costs for uninsured patients.

[![Care Credit](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/wp-content/themes/charlie/images/carecredit-logo.svg)](https://www.carecredit.com/)

Additionally, we partner with Cherry Financing to offer even more flexible payment solutions. Cherry Financing allows you to spread the cost of your dental treatments over several months to a year, making it easier to manage your expenses. With Cherry Financing, you can get the care you need without the financial stress, ensuring that your dental health is always a priority.

### Savings Plan

Affordable Coverage with Quality Care!

At Shoreline Dental Chicago, we are proud to offer our dental assistance savings plan (DASP) for new patients. This plan is designed to provide affordable coverage and greater access to quality dental care. With our DASP, you can experience the difference in your dental experience.

**Benefits of the Dental Discount Plan:**

- No Yearly Maximums: Unlike traditional dental insurance plans, our DASP does not impose any yearly maximum limits on your coverage. You can receive the dental care you need without worrying about reaching a cap.
- No Deductibles: Say goodbye to deductibles! Our DASP eliminates the need for deductibles, allowing you to receive dental services without any upfront costs.
- No Claim Forms: Hassle-free paperwork! With our DASP, you won’t have to deal with any claim forms. Simply schedule your appointment and enjoy the benefits.
- No Pre-Authorization: Skip the pre-authorization process. Our DASP allows you to receive immediate eligibility for dental services with no waiting periods.
- No Pre-Existing Condition Limitations: We believe that everyone deserves access to quality dental care, regardless of their pre-existing conditions. Our DASP does not impose any limitations based on pre-existing conditions.
- Complimentary Consultations: As a member of our DASP, you will enjoy complimentary consultations with our dental professionals. Get expert advice on your dental health without any additional cost.

### Frequently Asked Questions:

1\. How long am I enrolled in the Dental Assistance Plan?

The Dental Assistance Plan expires one year after activation. Please note that enrollment fees may change upon renewal.

2\. Is the Dental Assistance Plan the same as Dental Insurance?

Our plan is not an insurance plan. It provides discounted fees for dental services and payment is expected at the time of service. The plan cannot be combined with any other plans, discounts, or dental insurance.

**Program Details:**

- The Dental Assistance Plan is a discount plan, not a dental insurance plan.
- It cannot be used in conjunction with another dental plan or for treatment covered under workman’s compensation or medical insurance.
- The plan is only honored at Shoreline Dental Chicago and is not to be used with any other dental office.

**Program Guidelines:**

- The plan cannot be used in conjunction with another dental plan and is non-refundable.
- No refunds or premiums will be issued if a participant decides not to utilize the dental plan.
- Patient’s portion of the bill is due on the day of service, and no additional cash discounts will apply.
- Please provide 24-hour notice for appointment changes or cancellations to avoid a $50 broken appointment fee.
- A second broken appointment without 24-hour notice will nullify participation in the plan and all fees will be forfeited.
- Any costs associated with outside financing are the sole responsibility of the patient.

### Plan Summary:

**Our DASP offers comprehensive and comprehensive plus restorative coverage, with a variety of discounts available for different treatments and services. Here’s a summary of the plan:**

- Orthodontic Discount: 15%
- Periodontal Treatment Discount: 15%
