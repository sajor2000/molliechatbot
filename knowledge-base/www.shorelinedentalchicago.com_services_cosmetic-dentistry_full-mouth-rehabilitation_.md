# Full-Mouth Rehabilitation Chicago, IL

Full-mouth rehabilitation is a [comprehensive dental approach](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/ "Services") designed to restore both the health and appearance of your smile. If you are experiencing significant dental issues, such as damaged, decayed or missing teeth, this treatment may be the solution you need to regain confidence in your smile and improve your oral health.

## When is Full-Mouth Rehabilitation Recommended?

You may benefit from full-mouth rehabilitation if you are dealing with:

- Cracked, chipped or broken teeth
- Severe tooth wear
- Missing teeth
- Advanced gum disease
- Persistent tooth infections or decay

Full-mouth rehabilitation combines [restorative](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/ "Restorative Dentistry") and [cosmetic](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/ "Cosmetic Dentistry") dental treatments tailored to your specific needs. By developing a personalized treatment plan, our dentists will address the underlying issues affecting your smile while enhancing its overall aesthetics.

## What to Expect from Full-Mouth Rehabilitation

Your journey begins with a comprehensive examination to evaluate the health of your teeth, gums and jaw. Based on these findings, we will design a treatment plan that may include:

- **[Dental Crowns](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-crowns/ "Dental Crowns") and [Bridges](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-bridges/ "Dental Bridges"):** To restore strength and function to damaged or missing teeth.
- **[Dental Implants](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/oral-surgery/dental-implants/ "Dental Implants"):** A long-lasting solution for tooth replacement.
- **[Dentures](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dentures/ "Dentures"):** A practical option for replacing multiple teeth or an entire arch.
- **[Inlays, Onlays](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-inlays-onlays/ "Dental Inlays & Onlays") or [Fillings](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-fillings/ "Dental Fillings"):** To repair decayed or worn teeth.
- **[Veneers](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/cosmetic-dentistry/dental-veneers/ "Dental Veneers"):** To improve the appearance of chipped, cracked or discolored teeth.
- **[Gum Disease Treatment](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/gum-disease-treatment/ "Gum Disease Treatment"):** To restore the health of your gums and prevent further damage.
- **[Root Canal Therapy](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/root-canal-treatments/ "Root Canal Treatments"):** To save and preserve infected teeth.

Each step in your full-mouth rehabilitation plan is designed to work harmoniously, ensuring you achieve both a functional and beautiful smile.
