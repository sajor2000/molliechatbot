# Dental Inlays & Onlays Chicago, IL

Inlays and onlays are advanced dental [restorations](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/ "Restorative Dentistry") designed to repair moderate damage or decay in your teeth. If a traditional filling cannot adequately address the issue but the damage does not require a full [crown](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-crowns/ "Dental Crowns"), inlays and onlays may be an ideal solution. These restorations are often referred to as partial crowns because they provide durable and precise repair while preserving more of your natural tooth structure.

## Custom Restorations for Lasting Results

Dental inlays and onlays are custom-made from high-quality materials such as porcelain, composite resin or gold. Inlays are used to restore the areas between the cusps of a tooth, while onlays are designed to extend over one or more cusps. This distinction allows our dentists to address different levels of tooth damage while maintaining the integrity of your bite.

To create an inlay or onlay, [Dr. Mollie Rojas or Dr. Sonal Patel](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/about/meet-our-team/ "Meet Our Team") will first remove the damaged portion of the tooth and take a detailed impression. This impression is then used to craft a restoration that fits perfectly into the affected area. Once bonded to your tooth, the inlay or onlay blends seamlessly with your natural enamel, enhancing both function and aesthetics.

## The Benefits of Inlays & Onlays

Choosing an inlay or onlay offers several advantages. These restorations are more durable than traditional [fillings](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/services/restorative-dentistry/dental-fillings/ "Dental Fillings") and provide enhanced protection against future decay. Additionally, they are minimally invasive, meaning they conserve more of your natural tooth structure compared to crowns. The materials used are also highly resistant to staining, ensuring your smile stays bright and healthy-looking.

### Is an Inlay or Onlay Right for You?

Determining whether an inlay or onlay is appropriate depends on the extent of the damage to your tooth. During your visit, our dentists will carefully evaluate your oral health and discuss the best treatment options to meet your needs.

We invite you to [call](https://www.shorelinedentalchicago.com/contact-us/ "Contact Us") Shoreline Dental Chicago at 312-266-9487 and schedule a consultation today to learn more about dental inlays and onlays in Chicago, Illinois.
